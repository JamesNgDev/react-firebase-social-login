# Firebase Social Login Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use

Config the firebase config in `src/config.js`. Then run project

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Start app: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Notes

With Facebook Login, the client must has SSL. For me, I use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to serve my app.

### Install ngrok:

`sudo npm install -g ngork`

### Serve the app:

`ngrok http 3000`

## Enjoy!
